/*
Game engine class.
Two teams: red and blue team.
Initializes a game given two players. It initializes a Board with random words from a dictionary. It also assigns roles to the players (spymaster and guesser)
The dictionary could be something thatâ€™s hard coded
Game State (Board state, whose turn it is, points)
Methods for next move: given a player and a move, figure out the next state and return
- If a player makes a move (for example: guesses one word), determine the next state (for ex: dependant on a bunch of other rules)
Method for determining if match is over:
- If you click on a black card
- If you win the game (one team guesses all their words)
Method for restarting: all the words get reshuffled again, points reset to 0.
